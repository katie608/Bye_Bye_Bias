Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program Final Project

This is almost 3 years old and kinda broken. I wanted to see if I could get it up online again. It used to be hosted on IBM's bluemix platform but then the free trial expired. I think the bootstrap is also nonfunctional. Unfortunately the chat feature seems to be broken. Which is sad because it was actually functional and I had a lot of fun (and frustration) getting it to work. Well, here is this cobwebby website (cobwebsite?). Maybe I will get around to dusting it off one of these days. -Katie Foster
